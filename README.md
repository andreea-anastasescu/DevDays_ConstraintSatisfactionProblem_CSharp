# DevDays_ConstraintSatisfactionProblem_CSharp


This program solves a [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem)  problem.
This specific type of CSP is also known as zebra or Eistein riddle.

Below you can read the riddle itself:
 
“At the Endava DevWeek dinner party, there were Cypher, Neo, Apoc, Morpheus, and Trinity.
 
The five secretive developers sat in a row. In order to get with the unfortunate times we’re living in, they all wore masks of different colors. Morpheus wore a white one. Trinity was at the far left, next to the person wearing a green mask. The person with the purple mask sat left of someone wearing a red mask. Everyone remembered the purple mask, as the owner stained it all with their whisky. The .NET developer wore a blue mask. When one of the attendees bragged about their Chromebook, the .NET developer next to them said they are not very well suited for software development.
 
So Neo showed off a shiny MacBook, at which the Frontend developer scoffed, saying it was no match for their Alienware laptop. Someone else carried an expensive ThinkPad and when they saw it, the Java developer next to them nearly spilled the neighbor’s gin. Cypher raised a glass of rum in a toast. The Python developer, cheerful from all the wine, got up and tripped on a power cable, then fell onto the guest in the center seat, spilling the poor person’s beer. Then Apoc captivated them all with a story about a recent adventure in Mobile development.
 
By the end of the party, there were four unattended laptops lying around on the table: the Chromebook, the Surface, the Alienware, and the ThinkPad.
 
But which laptop belonged to whom?”
